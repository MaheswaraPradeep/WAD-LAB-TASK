      <p>
        A <b>database</b> is a structured collection of data that typically
        describes the activities of one or more organizations. For example, a
        university database might contain information about the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Entities such as students, faculty,courses,and classrooms.</li>
        <li>
          Relationships between entities, such as students' enrollment in
          courses, faculty teaching courses, and the use of rooms for courses.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Database Management System (DBMS) </b>is a software system that
        allows users to interact with a database. A database is a collection of
        organized data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. DBMS
        serves as an interface between the database and the users or application
        programs, ensuring that data is consistently organized and remains
        easily accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Database management systems encompass a microcosm of computer science at
        large. The field addresses a diverse range of issues and employs
        techniques that span a broad spectrum. This includes languages,
        object-orientation, various programming paradigms, compilation,
        operating systems, concurrent programming, data structures, algorithms,
        theoretical concepts, parallel and distributed systems, user interfaces,
        expert systems, artificial intelligence, statistical techniques, and
        dynamic programming. Although we cannot delve into all these aspects of
        database management in this book, it is evident that this discipline is
        rich and vibrant.
      </p>
      <p>
        The significance of database management is escalating with the
        increasing availability and accessibility of data online, facilitated by
        computer networking. Presently, the field is driven by compelling
        visions, including multimedia databases, interactive video, digital
        libraries, ambitious scientific projects such as the Human Genome
        Mapping effort and NASA's Earth Observation System project.
        Additionally, businesses are keen on consolidating their decision-making
        processes and extracting valuable information from their data
        repositories. In the commercial realm, database management systems
        constitute one of the largest and most dynamic market segments.
        Therefore, the exploration of database systems holds the potential for
        rich and multifaceted rewards.

      <center><h2>Ch2: ER Model</h2></center>
      <p>
        The entity-relationship (ER) data model allows us to describe the data
        involved in a real-world enterprise in terms of objects and their
        relationships and is widely used to develop an initial database design.
        In this chapter, we introduce the ER model and discuss how its features
        allow us to model a wide range of data faithfully.
      </p>
      <h3>ENTITIES, ATTRIBUTES, AND ENTITY SETS</h3>
      <p>
        An <b>entity</b> is an object in the real world that is distinguishable
        from other objects. Examples include the following: the Green Dragonzord
        toy, the toy department, the manager of the toy department, the home
        address of the manager of the toy department. It is often useful to
        identify a collection of similar entities. Such a collection is called
        an entity set. Note that entity sets need not be disjoint; the
        collection of toy department employees and the collection of appliance
        department employees may both contain employee John Doe (who happens to
        work in both departments). We could also define an entity set called
        Employees that contains both the toy and appliance department employee
        sets.
      </p>
      <p>
        An entity is described using a set of attributes. All entities in a
        given entity set have the same attributes; this is essentially what we
        mean by similar. Our choice of attributes reflects the level of detail
        at which we wish to represent information about entities. For example,
        the Employees entity set could use name, social security number (SSN),
        and parking lot (lot) as attributes. In this case, we will store the
        name, social security number, and lot number for each employee. However,
        we will not store, say, an employee's address or gender or age.
      </p>
      <h3>RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIP SETS</h3>
      <p>
        A relationship is an association among two or more entities. For
        example, we may have the relationship that Attishoo works in the
        pharmacy department. As with entities, we may wish to collect a set of
        similar relationships into a relationship set.

      <center><h2>Ch-3: Relational model</h2></center>
      <p>
        Codd proposed the relational data model in 1970. At that time, most
        database systems were based on one of two older data models (the
        hierarchical model and the network model). The relational model
        revolutionized the database field and largely supplanted these earlier
        models. Prototype relational database management systems were developed
        in pioneering research projects at IBM and UC-Berkeley by the mid-70s,
        and several vendors were offering relational database products shortly
        thereafter. Today, the relational model is by far the dominant data
        model and is the foundation for the leading DBMS products, including
        IBM's DB2 family, Informix, Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft's Access and SQL
        Server, FoxBase, and Paradox. Relational database systems are ubiquitous
        in the marketplace and represent a multibillion-dollar industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        The relational model is very simple and elegant; a database is a
        collection of one or more relations, where each relation is a table with
        rows and columns. This simple tabular representation enables even novice
        users to understand the contents of a database, and it permits the use
        of simple, high-level languages to query the data. The major advantages
        of the relational model over the older data models are its simple data
        representation and the ease with which even complex queries can be
        expressed.
      </p>
      <h3>Introduction to relational model</h3>
      <p>
        The main construct for representing data in the relational model is a
        relation. A relation consists of a relation schema and a relation
        instance. The relation instance is a table, and the relation schema
        describes the column heads for the table. We first describe the relation
        schema and then the relation instance. The schema specifies the
        relation's name, the name of each field (or column, or attribute), and
        the domain of each field. A domain is referred to in a relation schema
        by the domain name and has a set of associated values.
      </p>
      <p>An instance of the Students relation appears in Figure 3.1.</p>
      <img src="rm.png" alt="relational model" />
      <p>
        The instance S1 contains six tuples and has, as we expect from the
        schema, five fields. Note that no two rows are identical. This is a
        requirement of the relational model â€” each relation is defined to be a
        set of unique tuples or rows.

      <center><h2>Ch 4: Sql queries</h2></center>
      <p>
        Structured Query Language (SQL) is the most widely used commercial
        relational database language. It was originally developed at IBM in the
        SEQUEL-XRM and System-R projects (1974-1977). Almost immediately, other
        vendors introduced DBMS products based on SQL, and it is now a de facto
        standard. SQL continues to evolve in response to changing needs in the
        database area. Our presentation follows the current ANSI/ISO standard
        for SQL, which is called SQL-92. We also discuss some important
        extensions in the new standard, SQL:1999. While not all DBMS products
        support the full SQL-92 standard yet, vendors are working toward this
        goal, and most products already support the core features. The SQL
        language has several aspects to it:
      </p>
      <li>
        <b>The Data Definition Language (DDL):</b> This subset of SQL supports
        the creation, deletion, and modification of definitions for tables and
        views. Integrity constraints can be defined on tables, either when the
        table is created or later. The DDL also provides commands for specifying
        access rights or privileges to tables and views. Although the standard
        does not discuss indexes, commercial implementations also provide
        commands for creating and deleting indexes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>The Data Manipulation Language (DML):</b> This subset of SQL allows
        users to pose queries and to insert, delete, and modify rows.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Triggers: </b>The new SQL:1999 standard includes support for
        triggers, which are actions executed by the DBMS whenever changes to the
        database meet conditions specified in the trigger.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Security: </b>SQL provides mechanisms to control users' access to
        data objects such as tables and views.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Transaction management: </b>Various commands allow a user to
        explicitly control aspects of how a transaction is to be executed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Client-server execution and remote database access: </b>These
        commands control how a client application program can connect to an SQL
        database server or access data from a database over a network.
      </li>
      <p>The basic form of an SQL query is as follows</p>
      <pre>
SELECT [DISTINCT ]select-list 
FROM from-list 
WHERE qualication</pre
      >
      <p>
        Such a query intuitively corresponds to a relational algebra expression
        involving selections, projections, and cross-products. Every query must
        have a SELECT clause, which specifies columns to be retained in the
        result, and a FROM clause, which specifies a cross-product of tables.
        The optional WHERE clause specifies selection conditions on the tables
        mentioned in the FROM clause.
      </p>
      <p>We now consider the syntax of a basic SQL query in more detail.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <b>FROM-list</b> in the FROM clause is a list of table names. A
          table name can be followed by a range variable; a range variable is
          particularly useful when the same table name appears more than once in
          the FROM-list.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <b>select-list</b> is a list of (expressions involving) column
          names of tables named in the FROM-list. Column names can be prefixed
          by a range variable.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <b>qualification</b> in the <b>WHERE</b> clause is a boolean
          combination (i.e., an expression using the logical connectives AND,
          OR, and NOT) of conditions of the form expression op expression, where
          op is one of the comparison operators {<, <=, =, <>, >=, >}.
        </li>
        <li>
          The DISTINCT keyword is optional. It indicates that the table computed
          as an answer to this query should not contain duplicates, that is, two
          copies of the same row. The default is that duplicates are not
          eliminated.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We illustrate the conceptual evaluation strategy using the following
        query:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >(Q1) Find the names of sailors who have reserved boat number 103.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>It can be expressed in SQL as follows:</p>
      <pre>
SELECT S.sname
FROM Sailors S, Reserves R
WHERE S.sid = R.sid AND R.bid = 103;
        </pre
